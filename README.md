# The One Billion Row Challenge *with Metal and Rust*

> 1️⃣🐝🏎️🪙🦀

My attempt at completing [the One Billion Row Challenge (1BRC)] with [Metal]
[^1] and Rust. As of 4th May 2024, our GPU-only solution runs 11.2% faster
(1.0225s) than the fastest official Java [submission] (1.1375s) on my M1 Max
MacBook Pro.

[^1]: Apple's hardware-accelerated graphics and compute shader API
